2.2.9l

Added CongfigParser features instead of hidden files

Importand: if after performing an update you saw
that config file (not json) in directory:
'~/.ota_markers/ota_config.txt' is empty and you find
occasional errors during normal using of the software 
just remove that file entirely:
' rm ~/.ota_markers/ota_config.txt '
and than just open OTA again.
You can input config values manually in this file 
- just once.

Options: 1 means "true"

_________________________________________________________________


2.2.5 and higher

If you performed an update from 2.2.4 version or previous 
and you want to use custom pins as reset pins:

Change line in updater-config.json file so it looks like:

	"pins_assignment" : "custom"

So the file looks like this:

{
	"pi_user" : (...),
	"RH_version" : (...),
	"debug_user" : (...),
	"country" : (...),
	"nodes_number" : (...),
	"debug_mode" : 0,
	"pins_assignment" : "custom"
}

And than edit lines 60 to 67 in nodes_update.py file.

nano nodes_update.py

Happy flyin'!
