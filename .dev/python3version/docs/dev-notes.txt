        Developer notes:

This software is designed to work with python 2.7.
Will be converted to python 3 when RotorHazard will be converted as well. 

Some actions on system files are being performed during operations like UART enabling etc.
Admin privileges are only used when needed (eg. avrdude installation) or to ensure smooth operation.

Big part of this software acts like simple scripts. Automated actions like 'cp dir1 dir2' are being performed,
so user don't have to do it manually.

Software operates in user's home folder most of the time. It contains some code
that can change content of that folder. Some directories may be deleted to ensure smooth operation
in the future - eg. any "leftovers" from previous installation attempts like "RotorHazard-master"
or "temp.zip" may be deleted. No actuall installation or configuration files are intended to be deleted. 

Software also contains some compatibility-ensuring code in prev_comp.py file so first users have same, good experiences with this software.

Directory '/.dev' contains pieces of software which are not accessible by usual users, like test files etc.

You can enable debugging mode in wizard or in updater-config.json file so it can be evaluated on a PC.
Linux or WSL will be probably most compatible. 

Update notes may be read for new features description. 

Branches 'master' and 'no_pdf_included' are always up-to-date and valid to be used.
